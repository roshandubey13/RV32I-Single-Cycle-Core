# RISC-V 32I Single Cycle Processor

Implementation of a RISC-V single cycle architecture supporting six base instruction formats (R,I,S,B)

## Features
- 32-bit RV32I ISA implementation
- Single-cycle execution
- Verilog HDL implementation

##
-Update a fully functional Test bench to demonstarate various sorting algos performed by the chip
-Assembly to Test Bench tool so larger programs can be written
-Create Another Repo for pipeline implementation
